<summary><strong>1. Preferred Detector Run Configuration</strong></summary>

Compatible completed optimizer runs are coalesced by detector, workload, and concrete runner profile. Repeated shapes retain all observations; the preferred shape is selected canonically by throughput, then newest compatible optimizer run, then lower resource use within a run.

| Detector | Runner | CPU | Physical | Logical | RAM | Preferred pipelines | Threads / pipeline | Preferred shape range (≤2%) | Search method | Optimization time | Allocated | Sets/s | Shape time | Observations |
|---|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| scantailor_page_frame | 192t — rh8-al316 (192 vCPU) | AMD EPYC 9655 96-Core Processor | 192 | 192 | 2897.3 GiB | 1 | 384 | 1p/384t | legacy | 30s | 384 | 9.17 | 6s | 4 |

**Search method legend:** `adaptive` = sparse wide-range search with local refinement around the measured peak and ≤2% preferred-shape boundaries; `powers-of-2` = logarithmic power-of-two pipeline sweep; `exhaustive` = every legal pipeline count in the requested range.

**Shape-prediction coverage:** vCPU anchors `192`; readiness **low**; prediction checks **0 verified / 0 pending**.
**Desired / missing optimization data:** missing: a second vCPU size to establish shape scaling.

Shapes completed in this execution are shown below.

This table contains measurements from this optimizer execution only. Bold identifies this run’s measured throughput winner; the preferred configuration above is selected from all compatible coalesced optimizer evidence.

| Runner | Pipelines | Shards | Threads / pipeline | Allocated | Wall | Startup overhead | Sets/s | Speedup | Δ from run best | Avg load | Peak load | Avg CPU | Peak RAM |

**Startup-overhead note:** executor startup is measured from `run-detector-regressions` entry through detector lifecycle preparation, planning, shared learned-evidence resolution/preparation, and initial queue setup before pipeline fan-out. It remains included in **Wall** and therefore in shape-level **Sets/s** as a constant reminder of incurred end-to-end cost. Per-shard parameter-set throughput is timed after fan-out and does not include this pre-fan-out startup overhead.

**Early stop:** perceived throughput peak/plateau bracketed by completed shapes more than 2.0% below the peak on both available sides.
